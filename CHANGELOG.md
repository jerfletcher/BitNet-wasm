## Release Notes

### How to Upgrade

#### From Source
```bash
git pull origin main
./setup_and_build.sh
```

#### Direct Download
Download the latest files from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jerfletcher/BitNet-wasm/releases)

#### CDN
Update your import URL to use the latest version:
```javascript
import BitNetModule from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jerfletcher/BitNet-wasm@latest/bitnet.js';
```

### Breaking Changes

None in this release. The API remains backward compatible.

### Migration Guide

No migration required for existing integrations. New features are additive and don't affect existing functionality.

### Known Issues

- Large model loading may take significant time on slower connections
- Memory usage can be high for large models (1GB+ models require sufficient RAM)
- Some older browsers may have limited WebAssembly support

### Performance Improvements

- Optimized WASM compilation flags for better performance
- Improved memory management for large model loading
- Enhanced JavaScript-WASM interface efficiency

### Security Updates

- Updated build dependencies to latest versions
- Enhanced input validation for model loading
- Improved error handling to prevent potential issues
